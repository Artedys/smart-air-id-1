# Digital-Identity using ERC 725/735

An implementation of [ERC 725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) and [ERC 735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735), proposed standard for managing **Digital Identity** on the **Blockchain**. We uses the [Truffle framework](http://truffleframework.com/) and [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) for testing.

Using [ERC 725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725), a **Smart Contract** can protect function calls from being executed unless the **Sender** has a verified **Claim** from a trusted **Issuer**; e.g. build a mechanism into our Smart Contracts to only allow interactions from reputable people. ERC-725 allows for many more use-cases, such as multi-sig execution approvals and verification by contract call instead of key validation.

> **Demo Scripts**

Imagine we want to deploy a **Listing Contract** (e.g. post a job to hire a Freelancer), but only allow interactions from **Users** (e.g. Developers) with a verified `Has Facebook` & `Has Github`. How can we accomplish this with Digital Identity ERC-725?

> First, lets define the entities that will be interacting:
* The _Consumer:Developer_ is an identity who wants to apply a posted job.
* The _Issuer:SellerBuyerBroker_ is an identity which issues claims of type `FACEBOOK_VERIFIED` &  `GITHUB_VERIFIED`. *Note*: Buyer-Broker is HeadHunter.
* The _Listing:JobPosting_ will only allow _Consumer:Developer_ with `FACEBOOK_VERIFIED` &  `GITHUB_VERIFIED` claims from an _Issuer-HeadHunterService_ they trust.

> Second, _Consumer:Developer_ interact with a O2O-Identity Listing Contract by following process:

1. _Buyer:Employer_ deploys a new **Identity Contract** (or reuses one they deployed earlier).
2.  _Buyer:Employer_ visits O2O-Identity/verify and obtains a cryptographic signature proving that they control a particular `email` and `phone-number`.
3.  _Buyer:Employer_ adds this `Claim` to their `Identity Contract`.
4.  _Buyer:Employer_ tries to *apply a job* via a O2O-Identity `Listing Contract`.
5.  `Listing Contract` looks at _Buyer:Employer_â€™s `Identity` for a `Claim` issued by O2O-Identity.
6.  `Listing Contract` recovers the public key from the `Claim Signature` and verifies it is still valid on the O2O-Identity `Issuer Contract`.
7.  Transaction is allowed to proceed.

Now that the _Buyer:Employer_ has a verified claim on their identity from O2O-Identity, they can interact with any other contracts also accepting claims issued by O2O-Identity.

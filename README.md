# Digital-Identity using ERC 725/735

An implementation of [ERC 725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) and [ERC 735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735), proposed standard for managing **Digital Identity** on the **Blockchain**. We uses the [Truffle framework](http://truffleframework.com/) and [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) for testing.

Using [ERC 725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725), a **Smart Contract** can protect function calls from being executed unless the **Sender** has a verified **Claim** from a trusted **Issuer**; e.g. build a mechanism into our Smart Contracts to only allow interactions from reputable people. ERC-725 allows for many more use-cases, such as multi-sig execution approvals and verification by contract call instead of key validation.

> **Demo Scripts**

Imagine we want to deploy a **Listing Contract** (e.g. post a job to hire a Freelancer), but only allow interactions from **Users** (e.g. Developers) with a verified `Has Facebook` & `Has Github`. How can we accomplish this with Digital Identity ERC-725?

> First, lets define the entities that will be interacting:
* The _Consumer:Developer_ is an identity who wants to apply a posted job.
* The _Issuer:SellerBuyerBroker_ is an identity which issues claims of type `FACEBOOK_VERIFIED` &  `GITHUB_VERIFIED`. *Note*: Buyer-Broker is HeadHunter.
* The _Listing:JobPosting_ will only allow _Consumer:Developer_ with `FACEBOOK_VERIFIED` &  `GITHUB_VERIFIED` claims from an _Issuer-HeadHunterService_ they trust.

> Second, _Consumer:Developer_ interact with a O2OIssuer/SellerBuyerBroker Listing Contract by following process:

1. _Buyer:Employer_ deploys a new **Identity Contract** (or reuses one they deployed earlier).
2.  _Buyer:Employer_ visits O2OIssuer/SellerBuyerBroker/verify and obtains a cryptographic signature proving that they control a particular `email` and `phone-number`.
3.  _Buyer:Employer_ adds this `Claim` to their `Identity Contract`.
4.  _Buyer:Employer_ tries to *apply a job* via a O2OIssuer/SellerBuyerBroker `Listing Contract`.
5.  `Listing Contract` looks at _Buyer:Employer_â€™s `Identity` for a `Claim` issued by O2OIssuer/SellerBuyerBroker.
6.  `Listing Contract` recovers the public key from the `Claim Signature` and verifies it is still valid on the O2OIssuer/SellerBuyerBroker `Issuer Contract`.
7.  Transaction is allowed to proceed.

Now that the _Buyer:Employer_ has a verified claim on their identity from O2OIssuer/SellerBuyerBroker, they can interact with any other contracts also accepting claims issued by O2OIssuer/SellerBuyerBroker.

## Demo Walkthrough

1. Screen upon loading: first Wallet-ID `0x313A` for a person who desires a blockchain identity (_Consumer:Developer_).

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725.png)

2. Click "Add an Identity" and deploy an identity contract with name "DevOps".

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725-New-Identity.png)

You can see the address of the Contract, as well as the Wallet-ID of the Owner. 

3. Switch the active wallet to the second, `0x56BE`, for the role of a service that can verify `Has Facebook` or `Has GitHub` (_Issuer:SellerBuyerBroker_).

Again, you should see the address of this Contract, and the Wallet-ID of the Owner of this Contract. 

4. Switch the active wallet to the third, `0xCd5e` for the role to restrict access to only people with verified Facebook/Github accounts. (A marketplace for developers)

5. Click "Add a Claim Checker" and deploy a contract called "Job Posting" with certifier of `Has Facebook`. This is the contract which will be limited to interacting to people with verified Facebook accounts. 

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725-Claim-Checker.png)

6. Switch to the first Wallet, belonging to "DevOps" then Click on the `Apply Job!` Listing Contract. After clicking on "Check Claim", you should see that the claim is returned as **ClaimInvalid**. At this point, `DevOps` has no proof that has a Facebook account. 

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725-Claim-Checker-Invalid.png)

7. In right column, you should see the `Add Claim` by our "SellerBuyerBroker" Certifier  that has a Facebook account. Click "Approve" to accept this claim to Alice's identity. 

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725-Identities-Claims-1.png)

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725-Identities-Claims-2.png)

`DevOps now has on-chain proof of `Facebook`!

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725-Identities-Claims-3.png)

8. Now click the `Job Posting` Listing Contract under `
Claim Checkers`, and then click on `Apply Job!` then `Check Claim`; You should see that this claim is returned as **ClaimValid***. 

![image](dist/README/Digital-Identity-ERC-725-Claim-Checker-Valid.png)

`DevOps` is ready to start doing Blockchain Freelancer Marketplace!
